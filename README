This is a Boggle board generator with a few extra features.

Method:
You can change which method the Boggle board gets generated. 
	"boggle"
		Generate a board that could be generated with Boggle cubes.
		I programmed the actual cubes that exist so there is a chance
		that words exist instead of a board full of Zs.
	"random"
		For science, I added a feature that just creates a whole board
		of random letters. It could just create a board with no vowels
		or all the same letters. But it's there.
		
Mode:
You can change how Boggle works. One generates one board and you can find
words in it. Otherwise you could read a text file of words and see how many
boards you need to generate to contain one of those words
	"play"
		Just print one board and search for words in it. At the moment
		it does not check them against a dictionary.
	"file"
		Loads the text file "words.txt" in and generates as many boards
		as it takes to contain at least one of the words in the file. It
		then prints the results it finds including the coordinates of the
		word.
